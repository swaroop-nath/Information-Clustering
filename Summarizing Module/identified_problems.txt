1. Bifurcations in the graph has been dealt with correctly, like branching from path 2 to 2 and 21. But, have amalgamations been dealt with/considered? Do they need separate treatment. --> No, any such special treatment isn't required
2. The loop seems to run infinitely. Check if it actually runs infinitely or it takes huge time. --> It does run infinitely, due to the fact that cyclic sections of the graph have not been dealt with. --> Resolved
3. Duplicate bifurcation. 2 bifurcates into 2 and 21. In the future if 2 needs to bifurcate again, it will again produce 21. While bifurcation, check for existing keys in the paths dictionary. --> Resolved.
